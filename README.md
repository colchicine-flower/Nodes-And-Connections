# Nodes And Connections – Java Project

This project demonstrates a customizable and expandable node–connection data structure implemented in Java.
Each Node object stores a numeric value, a name, a type (optional), and maintains a list of Connection objects that link
it to other nodes.
With this structure, users can build flexible networks, visualize connections, and perform grouped data calculations.

## 📌 Features

### 🔗 Node & Connection Architecture
Each Node contains:

- A numeric value
- A name (string)
- A type (string — optional)
- A list of outgoing connections

Each Connection contains:

- A connection name
- The target node to which it links
  This design allows creation of dynamic networks, graphs, or hierarchical structures.

### 📂 Displaying Connections

Using the `displayConnections()` method on any node prints all reachable connections visually in a tree-like format.
Special formatting rules:

The starting node is shown with the label "Start Node"
Direct children of the starting node are printed in a flat aligned format
Deeper levels are displayed as a branching tree for easier readability

### Example Output:

```Start Node: Node0
Node1
Node2
Node3
Node4
 └─ Node5
     └─ Node6
 └─ Node7
```

### ➕ Summing Node Values

Two calculation methods exist:

`ConnectionsDataSum()`

- Traverses all connected nodes recursively
- Prints the total sum of values found in the entire network

`printSumByType(String type)`

- Sums only nodes whose type matches
  - If no type is given, the method uses the caller node's type as the default

`printSumByType()`

- Uses current node's own type

`printSumByType("TypeA")`

- Uses explicit type

### 🚀 Example Usage (Main)

```
Node n0 = new Node(5,"Node0");
Node n1 = new Node(10,"Node1");
Node n2 = new Node(15,"Node2");
Node n3 = new Node(20,"Node3");
Node n4 = new Node(25,"Node4");
Node n5 = new Node(30,"Node5");
Node n6 = new Node(35,"Node6");
Node n7 = new Node(12,"Node7");

n0.createConnection("con1",n1);
n0.createConnection("con2",n2);
n0.createConnection("con3",n3);
n0.createConnection("con4",n4);
n1.createConnection("con5",n5);
n5.createConnection("con6",n6);
n2.createConnection("con7",n7);

n0.displayConnections();
n0.ConnectionsDataSum();
```

| Use-Case	          | Example                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Game development   | 	Skill trees, crafting networks, tech trees         |
| Data visualization | 	Family trees, organization charts, linked datasets |
| AI / Pathfinding   | 	Weighted graph structures                          |
| Education	         | Teaching recursion, graph traversal, OOP            |

## 📌 Summary

This project is an example of an object-oriented and recursive graph system built with Java. It supports:

- Custom node-to-node relationships
- Hierarchical visualization
- Full and grouped numeric calculations

It provides a strong foundation for building more advanced graph-based applications.
